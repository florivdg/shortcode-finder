== Description ==

**Shortcode Finder** is a powerful WordPress admin tool that helps you locate where shortcodes are being used across your entire website. Whether you're cleaning up old shortcodes, debugging issues, or planning content migration, this plugin makes it easy to find every instance of any shortcode.

= Key Features =

* **Comprehensive Search**: Search through all published posts, pages, and custom post types
* **Flexible Input**: Enter shortcode names with or without brackets (e.g., "gallery" or "[gallery]")
* **Instant Results**: Fast AJAX-powered search with no page reloads
* **Detailed Results**: See post titles, post types, and direct edit/view links
* **Admin-Only Access**: Secure tool available only to administrators
* **Clean Interface**: Simple, intuitive design that matches WordPress admin styling

4. View results with direct links to edit each page or post

The plugin searches for all shortcode variations including:

* Self-closing shortcodes: `[shortcode /]`
* Enclosing shortcodes: `[shortcode]content[/shortcode]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin affect my site's frontend performance? =

No. Shortcode Finder only runs in the WordPress admin area and has zero impact on your site's frontend performance.

= What user roles can access this plugin? =

Only administrators (users with the `manage_options` capability) can access and use Shortcode Finder.

= Can I search for multiple shortcodes at once? =

Currently, the plugin searches for one shortcode at a time. This ensures accurate results and optimal performance.

= Does it search in draft or private posts? =

By default, Shortcode Finder only searches in published posts to show you active content. Draft and private posts are excluded.

= Can I search for shortcodes with specific attributes? =

Enter just the shortcode name (e.g., "gallery") to find all instances regardless of their attributes.

= Is the search case-sensitive? =

No, the search is case-insensitive. Searching for "Gallery" will find [gallery], [GALLERY], and [Gallery].

= Does it work with custom post types? =

Yes! Shortcode Finder searches through all public post types registered in your WordPress installation.

= What happens if I deactivate the plugin? =

Simply deactivating removes the admin menu item. No data is stored in the database, so deactivation is clean and safe.
